# Sensing Signal Processing (SensingSP™)

## Overview
**SensingSP™** is an open-source library designed for simulating electromagnetic sensing systems and implementing signal processing and machine learning algorithms.

## Features
- Simulate electromagnetic-based sensing systems.
- Implement advanced radar and signal processing algorithms.
- Leverage machine learning techniques for enhanced sensing capabilities.

## Installation
To install SensingSP™ and its dependencies, run the following command:
```bash
pip install sensingsp
```

## Project Source Code
The source code for SensingSP™ is available on GitHub:
[https://github.com/sensingsp/sensingsp](https://github.com/sensingsp/sensingsp)

## Example
The radar range equation is:

$$
P_r = \frac{P_t G_t G_r \lambda^2 \sigma}{(4\pi)^3 R_t^2 R_r^2 L}
$$

For monostatic radar systems, it simplifies to:

$$
P_r = \frac{P_t G^2 \lambda^2 \sigma}{(4\pi)^3 R^4 L}
$$
